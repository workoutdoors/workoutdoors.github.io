<h3 id="well-if-you-are-targeting-weight-loss-then-it-will-definitely-be-useful-because-green-tea-has-been-proven-to-be-a-good-fat-burner">Well if you are targeting weight loss, then it will definitely be useful because green tea has been proven to be a good fat burner.</h3><p>Im looking for a little boost before my workouts. If you have tried it let me know your results with it and what type of green tea you take. One of the main reasons that i occasionally drink a pre workout supplement or coffee before a workout instead of green tea is that green tea does not contain much caffeine and sometimes i want to drink something that provides more. Although there are many benefits of drinking green tea before a workout, there are some cons of drinking green tea pre workout as well.

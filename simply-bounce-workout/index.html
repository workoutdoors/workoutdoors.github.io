This will not allow you to simply ‘bounce’ the weight out of the bottom position and will build immense tricep strength. Get this down and the rest will eventually fall into place. Since it’s a light exercise, most people find it easy to perform the routine even for an hour or longer. You are not going to grind this lift out and you’re not going to see a slow tempo notation assigned to this lift. A little drill i like to do before i’ve even picked up the rope is to simply bounce gently from one foot to the other.</p>

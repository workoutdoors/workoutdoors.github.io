<h3 id="repeat-for-10-circuits-until-youre-doing-only-one-rep-per-exercise">Repeat for 10 circuits (until you’re doing only one rep per exercise).</h3><p>All sports that needs protective equipment is more extreme as ice hockey, motocross, mountain biking, scuba diving, skydiving, free climbing, any sort of skiing etc. The idea here is to build up your overall endurance and stamina, so you stay sharp no matter how long the game goes. Here are four extreme core exercises that will put you to the test. They have the potential to prevent injury, increase work capacity, improve an athlete’s innate movement ability as well as increase strength.

<p>You don’t need to (and shouldn’t) do abs for hours before your cardio; Seriously, working abs first or later is fine as long as you still have sufficient core strength to safely finish your subsequent workout. Believe it or not the spine is designed to flex and i believe it should be trained in ways it can move. You don�t need to (and shouldn�t) do abs for hours before your cardio;</p>
<h3 id="eat-something-before-your-workout">Eat something before your workout.</h3><p>These moves only work the muscles that allow you. Schedule time for an ab workout two to three times a week. Drink at least 100ml before your workout. Ab exercises should be incorporated into all of your workouts, whether it�s a deadlift (yes, they work your posterior core) or a russian twist, but when you do. The majority of fitness experts will advise you to do the cardio after the weight training, because if you do cardio first, it uses up much of the energy source for your anaerobic work (strength training) and fatigues the muscles before their most strenuous activity. In the end, whether you choose to do your ab workouts first or last is up to you.</p>

<p>I am sadly regretting having the surgery so soon now due to the fact that i planned on re enlisting in the military asap.

<p>In the initial days after surgery, any type of heavy or intense exercise is prohibited. After the gallbladder has been removed, recovery time varies depending on how serious the illness was beforehand so healing may take up to several months before returning back to normal activities. After this period of time you can begin lifting heavier objects being aware that.</p>

<p>Walking short distances for exercise is acceptable. You should not lift anything heavier than 8 to 10 pounds (a gallon of milk) for 2 weeks. It helps pump oxygen to the body tissues and releases endorphins that help reduce stress levels and even give energy. This is due to the fact that gallbladder surgery requires general anaesthesia, which can increase.</p>

<p>Yes, check with your doctor next week and donï¿½t do it before then. It can take a bit longer to return to these activities after open gallbladder removal surgery. Avoid lifting more than 10 pounds for four weeks and excessive bending or twisting for one to two weeks following surgery. If you âre fit and did regular exercise before the.</p>

This includes strenuous activities such as vacuuming, cycling, jogging, mowing lawns, moving furniture, aerobic exercises, lifting children, heavy groceries, laundries, backpacks and etc. If you âre fit and did regular exercise before the operation, your doctor may let you start exercising again when.</p>

<p>I know this is old but to let others know, itï¿½s best to really wait at least 4 weeks, even 2 months. I think you should be able to resume moderate exercise quite quickly, and your full exercise schedule within a couple of weeks, but check with your surgeon and follow his recommendation about this. Proper rest is essential for.</p>

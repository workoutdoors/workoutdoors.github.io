There are many variables which need to be taken into consideration when implementing a concurrent training plan. Concurrent training is one method that many coaches employ as it consists of training multiple qualities at equal amounts of focus within the same training phase and often within the same workout. Another variation on concurrent training is to mix aerobic training with resistance training, an approach aptly named integrated concurrent training because you’re integrating the two forms of training into a single workout. To achieve this goal, most of your time must be spent moving. This differs from a body part split, which focuses on a few muscle groups per training session.</p>

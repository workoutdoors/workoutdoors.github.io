<p>Listen to your body and progress at your own pace. Exercise during therapy and monitor skin healing perform these exercises every day until your shoulder movement is back to normal. I haven�t had surgery but from what i understand resuming exercise would depend on how soon your level of thyroid hormone reaches therapeutic level. Practise the basic movements you need to drive safely.</p>
<h3 id="i-haven039t-had-surgery-but-from-what-i-understand-resuming-exercise-would-depend-on-how-soon-your-level-of-thyroid-hormone-reaches-therapeutic-level">I haven�t had surgery but from what i understand resuming exercise would depend on how soon your level of thyroid hormone reaches therapeutic level.</h3><p>Don’t do significantly more than 3 times a day, 5 to 10 repeats. These gentle stretches include flexion and rotation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, flexion and extension of the posterior neck muscles, lateral side bends to stretch the sides of the neck and shoulder shrugs. Here are a few notes on my recovery process following the thyroidectomy surgery. Fortunately, the use of medications such as dexamethasone has greatly reduced the incidence of vomiting, and if nausea does develop, there are treatments that can alleviate your symptoms. The effects of the stretching exercises on the participants� neck pain and disability, neck sensitivity, pain with neck movements as well as on wound healing, were evaluated at the end of the first week and at 1 month following surgery. Appropriate treatment soon after thyroidectomy (surgical removal of the thyroid) should include thyroid hormone replacement.</p>

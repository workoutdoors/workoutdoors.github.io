There could be a registration fee, an annual maintenance fee, and a cancellation fee. We all have had experiences with hidden fees (cell phones hello…). Many people misunderstand the term “personal trainers” and think they will have a private professional at planet fitness. Customers should be aware that planet fitness charges a $39 annual membership fee that is typically assessed in october. Depends on the membership honestly.</p>

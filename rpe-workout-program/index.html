<p>10 week powerlifting program (rpe, meet prep) created and shared by kroamatik as a “generic 10 week program” structured around 4 days per week. Week 2 — 4 sets at rpe 7. With each drop in repetition, exercises change. If you are still confused on rpe, we have covered this in detail here.</p>

This chapter concerns the rate of perceived exertion (rpe) system in reactive training. Rpe allows you to train to a specific intensity to meet the goals of a particular workout. Rpe is more easily understood visually with a chart (taken from our 6 day workout routine plan): Let’s say you’re running my minimal routine which is an adaptation of pavel tsatsouline’s fighter pullup program and you finished your 5 sets of pullups and pushups. For example, if rate of perceived exertion is 6 and the workout took 50 minutes to complete, the rpe load would be 300.</p>

<p>While heart rate (hr) is a popular way to measure exercise intensity, we prefer ratings of perceived exertion (rpe) and will explain why in this post.

<p>Rpe is how hard something feels to you at the time. Below is an example of a workout in a training log. For example, if rate of perceived exertion is 6 and the workout took 50 minutes to complete, the rpe load would be 300. In this example the athlete (jane) does her warmup, followed by a set or two.</p>

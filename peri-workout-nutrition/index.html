PeriWorkout Nutrition �How To� Strategy For Maximum From ast-ss.com</p>
<p>After rather extensive amount of reading and experimenting with this subject i have realized how incredibly important this is to my training and recovery. There’s hundreds of different opinions out there when it comes to what you should and shouldn’t eat before, during and after a workout… the majority of which are bs. By ingesting protein before and during a workout, you spare muscle protein, negate protein degradation, and set the muscle up for regeneration and remodeling. For training sessions exceeding 2 hours in duration, an intra workout snack should be considered to maintain blood glucose levels.</p>

Branched chain amino acids (and other essential amino acids) 2.3. If there’s one aspect of peri workout nutrition that hasn’t been downplayed over the years is the need to consume some form of nutrition immediately after your workout, i.e. While consuming some whey protein immediately post workout is a good idea, there’s a way we can enhance your post workout nutrition even. There is plenty of evidence and success to show that taking specific nutrients immediately before, during and after training can have a measurable impact on the performance during the session in terms of weight lifted and work done. Depleted dieters, like people preparing for physique competition, may benefit from extra fuel.</p>

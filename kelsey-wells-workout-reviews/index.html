<p>I�m a decent though inconsistent weight lifter (bench 75lb, squat 130, deadlift 145). She rose to fame after a transformation photo she posted urging women to screw the scales went viral in 2016. An optional burnout is added from week 5 onward and as the weeks progress, the program builds to keep you challenged. I worked out for three months straight using the kelsey wells program and gained weight.</p>
<h3 id="the-heaviest-dumbells-i-have-at-home-were-12lb-but-if-i-had-stayed-with-the-program-i-think-i-would-have-purchased-15lb-dumbells">The heaviest dumbells i have at home were 12lb, but if i had stayed with the program, i think i would have purchased 15lb dumbells.</h3><p>Resistance training makes up the core of bbg. These workouts can have a positive effect on so many areas of your life — you aren’t just gaining strength on the outside, but inside as well. I worked out for three months straight using the kelsey wells program and gained weight. If you are unable to complete the workout all at once, you could attempt to modify the workouts. This review covers my thoughts on another sweat app (or bbg) program called pwr at home by kelsey wells and this time i found better results! The first, and imo the hardest, is activation.</p>

<p>If you’re anything like me, you might’ve started many workout programs that you never.

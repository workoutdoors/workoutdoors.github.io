<p>Abs during pregnancy…it may seem odd to strengthen your core during pregnancy when your belly is expanding and your abs are separating. If your test indicates that you may have diastasis, or if you�re not sure, ask your doctor or midwife to perform the test and to provide a recommendation as to how much/what type of exercise you are safe.</p>

<p>Stick to prenatal focused workouts and whole core instead of targeting specific ab muscles. However, you want to consult with a doctor before beginning any new workouts during pregnancy. When in doubt keep movements small and controlled. Add 5 minutes each week until you can stay active for 30 minutes a day. Do not attempt ab exercises for the first.</p>

<p>If your test indicates that you may have diastasis, or if you�re not sure, ask your doctor or midwife to perform the test and to provide a recommendation as to how much/what type of exercise you are safe to participate in.

<p>When in doubt keep movements small and controlled. Add 5 minutes each week until you can stay active for 30 minutes a day.

<p>If part of your first trimester ab workout includes a pilates or yoga class, you�re advised to do modified versions of both of these practices. You can be active and not do ab targeted workouts.

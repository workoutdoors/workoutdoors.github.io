There are 3 variations of the program to choose from, depending on what your secondary goals are. The linear group in this study changed their loads every four weeks. A study done in 2002 (1)compared undulating programming to linear programming. A program that only lasts a few months could fall under this category, as well as longer programs that last a year or more.</p>

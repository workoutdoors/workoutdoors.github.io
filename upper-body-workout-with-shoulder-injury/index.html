Rotator Cuff Exercises From forums.steroid.com</p>
<p>No exercises though that put alot of strain on the cuff like bench presses, upright rows and barbell curls. When done correctly, this exercise can build scapular stability and increase upper pec, deltoid, and tricep strength. I remember being able to do light smith machine shoulder presses. Make sure to include these in your upper body routine for a balanced fitness program.</p>

Make sure to include these in your upper body routine for a balanced fitness program. If you have elbow pain, foam roll and mobilize the heck out of your thoracic spine, pecs, and lats. Exercises to strengthen your shoulder would be well below. Exercise may help to balance and strengthen muscles around the shoulder so that they protect the shoulder from further damage. Exercises may help to improve the position of your shoulder joint and scapula.</p>

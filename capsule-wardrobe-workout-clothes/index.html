<h3 id="i-thought-it-would-be-a-great-opportunity-to-pare-down-the-unnecessary-pieces-ive">I thought it would be a great opportunity to pare down the unnecessary pieces i‚Äôve.</h3><p>All of these pieces should be interchangeable for the most part. I don‚Äôt generally create checklists because i think minimalism is personal, and there is no ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù capsule wardrobe solution.

My current transitional wardrobe includes 10 tops, 5 bottoms, 1 dress, 1 cardigan, 1 jacket and 3 pairs of shoes. Make sure to bring the basics in a compression packing cube: When i mix these items together i get at least 45 versatile outfits that are perfect for working from home, going for walks and leisure time.</p>

The vince gironda inspired 8x8 workout. The workout is known as the 8×8 workout and was (and still is) a popular bodybuilding routine to fine tune muscular imbalance for improved aesthetics, as well as improving cardiovascular health due to the high volume. The workouts are brutal, so be sure to give your body enough time to recover so you can go hard the next time you�re in the gym. The two chest exercises vince recommended the most was the neck press with a wide grip and very wide grip dips and very wide reverse grip dips. I�ve never been more sore in my biceps than with this workout.</p>

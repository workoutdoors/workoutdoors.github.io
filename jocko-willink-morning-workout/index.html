A retired Navy SEAL commander breaks down his morning From businessinsider.com.au</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean willink trains with intensity every day. Take one look at retired united states navy seal jocko willink — former commander of the most decorated special operations unit in the iraq war, task unit bruiser — and his daily morning workout regiment and you’ll surely have doubts about the legitimacy of your own. Former navy seal officer john jocko willink said that discipline is the most important factor in getting fit. Why do you want to get a good workout early in the morning?</p>
<h3 id="but-the-words-that-stuck-with-me-most-were-dont-think">But the words that stuck with me most were “don’t think”.</h3><p>John gretton ‘jocko’ willink is a retired us navy seal who spent 20 years in the service. Most of the time, his day begins with a push / pull workout with free weights and machines. But the words that stuck with me most were “don’t think”. He�ll also add core work and cardio into the mix a few times a week. He doesn�t get hungry until around noon, and only has a snack, like a few handfuls of nuts, in the morning. Jocko’s own combat experience, coupled with the time he’s spent instructing the next generation of seal leaders, make him someone who is worthy of your time and attention.</p>

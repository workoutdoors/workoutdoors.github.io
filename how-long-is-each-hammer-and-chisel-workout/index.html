<p>How long is the hammer and chisel workout program? What i really like about hammer and chisel is the length of the workouts. With the masters hammer and chisel workout, you are essentially getting three workouts in one. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed each review. So the average hammer and chisel workout length is about 35 minutes, which is a great length.</p>

<p>So yesterday was my day 1 of the new beachbody program called hammer and chisel. Hammer &amp; chisel includes 14 workouts on 6 dvds, and each workout is about 40 minutes.

<p>The workouts themselves are fine, but it’s not feasible to do full body lifting workouts 6 days a week, as your muscle groups need rest.

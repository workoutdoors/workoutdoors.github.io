Watch Weightlifter Clarence Kennedy Clean A Huge 230kg From barbend.com</p>
<p>When clarence cleaned 170 kilos he squatted 220 kilos. He was back in training again recently, showing off that strength in a big way. The video demonstrates different angles of the lift by kennedy. Each week of the program consists of 5 sessions.</p>
<h3 id="weighted-back-extensions-rear-delt-flys">Weighted back extensions, rear delt flys;</h3><p>He likes squatting almost every day, with fairly high volume (for example 5×5 for 4 days straight, 1 day off) he also started a patreon page. His internet fans wait patiently for an unscheduled random youtube upload or instagram post to learn more. Stacking the middle of the week with two days on is possible because day three on the program is a lighter day, so your squats will be at a lower intensity and jerks are rarely as taxing as the classical full lifts. There are 100s of exclusive videos on here right now for only $1 per month, this includes training commentary videos, q&amp;as, informative videos and much more. This record was a 231kg clean and jerk, made by tian tao. For the clean use a power clean + front squat and a jerk (power or split depending on your comfort).</p>

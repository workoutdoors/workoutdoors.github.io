<p>For runners preparing for 5k and 10k races, threshold intervals offer both the benefits of shorter track workouts, such as improved running economy, and of tempo runs, such as increased lactate threshold. The overall aim for training and racing is for your heart rate to remain lower even at a faster pace as this means you can sustain this faster pace for longer. 2 sets of 3x1km repetitions with 45 seconds recovery between repetitions and 2 minute recovery between sets. If it’s not convenient to get an lt test now, then base your lt on your best 10km running pace.</p>
<h3 id="in-physiology-terms-lactate-threshold-is-the-fastest-running-speed">In physiology terms, lactate threshold is the fastest running speed.</h3><p>The faster you can run while still clearing lactate, the faster you’ll be able to race. Lactate threshold workouts work so well because they flood your body with lactic acid and the other metabolites that contribute to running fatigue. Lactate threshold workouts are known to deliver immense benefits for half marathon and marathon runners, where fast paces need to be sustained for more than an hour. The lactate thresh hold workout it is possibly one of the most important workouts for runners looking to improve in distances between 8km and half marathon. This workout combines a varying pace through your 3 ranges of lactate threshold (lt). Lactate threshold workouts work so well because they flood your body with lactic acid and the other metabolites that contribute to running fatigue.</p>

The 12 Days of Christmas Workouts to Keep Your Gains Gym From gymjunkies.com</p>
<p>It does not have to take a whole year to get back into shape if you start right now and stay consistent. 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps. With christmas (2021) and new year underway, many people plan to indulge in a little too much food and drinks (if you haven’t already!). For the purpose of continued muscle growth and fat loss over the holidays, i have used the principles of cycling that i always preach about in order to create a routine that will keep the muscle growth/fat loss process going during the next few months with minimum visits to the gym.</p>
<h3 id="for-the-upper-body-workouts-you-will-be-training-your-chest-back-shoulders-biceps-and-triceps-to-some-degree">For the upper body workouts you will be training your chest, back, shoulders, biceps, and triceps to some degree.</h3><p>“this 12 days of christmas concept has been some of my class member’s favorite for many years now!” says the passionate pt. What i do recommend is enjoying the holidays the way you want to enjoy them. By doing your workout just before a big holiday dinner, all that food is going to go towards helping your body rebuild and recover from the workout. Immediately after a hard workout, your body is desperate for raw materials to rebuild with. However, the holidays should be different. If you can�t get to the gym but have a stability ball and either dumbbells or a resistance band at home, you can perform this workout between holiday gift wrapping and whipping up a batch of protein eggnog.</p>

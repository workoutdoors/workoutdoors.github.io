<p>This from ned farr, director and creator of the p90x infomercials! You did one round of p90x. I had seen the infomercials for p90x several times and must admit, those infomercials are really well done. 225 cheated shrugs, shoulder presses on a cybex machine with 50 pounds (yes, 50) and calf raises with the same weight.

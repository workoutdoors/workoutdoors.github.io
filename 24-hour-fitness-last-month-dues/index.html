<p>I received an email from 24 hour fitness informing me that they are not charging dues last month. He told us not to worry about next month�s payment as this will cover for september and october but he lied to us. I don’t know anyone paying gym dues to 24 hour fitness. I signed up for 6 fitness sessions and a monthly membership (at $30.99 / month).</p>
<h3 id="we-got-charged-in-october-as-well">We got charged in october as well.</h3><p>Pay first and last month’s dues. The general public rate is anywhere from is 29.99/month with a 49.99 initiation fee plus your first and last months dues. After 12 months, commitment memberships continue on a monthly basis. We got charged in october as well. I signed up with 24 hour fitness on 01/01/2007. Rather than contacting 24 hour fitness which i have over the last 4 months to request a copy of my original contract, i will file a small claim suit in court to see if an injunction can be issued to prevent the fee increase.</p>

<p>Don�t take an official rest—go back and forth from arm to arm until three sets per arm are completed. For instance, you would complete two or three sets of 12 to 15 reps of dumbbell concentration curls and then begin performing standing barbell curls. Using bicep power curl the barbell upward in a semi circular motion to just below the chin and tense those biceps hard for a second, lower back to. The bench press is a compound exercise that targets the chest but the front delts and triceps are also heavily involved in the movement.</p>

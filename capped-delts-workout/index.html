<p>Not only do they target both the lateral and rear delts for hypertrophy, but they also work the traps, rhomboids and rotator cuffs for improved upper back gains and shoulder health. I would even advise hitting a pump focused lateral movement and rear movement at the end of each chest day too. Keep each of them to just three sets. This video i go over my three exercise that will blow your shoulders up.</p>
<h3 id="so-warm-up-will-ya">So warm up, will ya?</h3><p>Not only do they target both the lateral and rear delts for hypertrophy, but they also work the traps, rhomboids and rotator cuffs for improved upper back gains and shoulder health. It is literally the only isolation exercise you have to do if you want good shoulder development. To start, set up a flat bench in the middle of two low cable pulleys that are opposite each other. You can make this into a shoulder workout as well just just do 2 rounds of all 10 exercises. This will give you a shoulder burn you have never felt. This video i go over my three exercise that will blow your shoulders up.</p>

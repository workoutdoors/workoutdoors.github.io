The product does not have any sugar in it and therefore it is far much healthy alternative compared to the energy drinks that are sugary.</p>
<h3 id="when-it-is-combined-with-caffeine-it-increases-cognitive-functions--18-">When it is combined with caffeine, it increases cognitive functions ( 18 ).</h3><p>It’s very strong, and very inexpensive. The product does not have any sugar in it and therefore it is far much healthy alternative compared to the energy drinks that are sugary. The drink is a blend of a complex antioxidant component made from 19 different fruits. Gfuel is a natural energy drink formula by gamma labs that quickly made a name for itself in the highly competitive esports / gaming world, where performance, focus, endurance and energy are key. Known as nature’s power bar, bananas are packed with carbohydrates and potassium, which supports nerve and muscle function. Because they are full of fiber, oats release carbohydrates gradually.</p>

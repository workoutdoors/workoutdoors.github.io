<p>Keep your shoulders down, back straight, and elbows glued to your sides. Bring the dumbbells from fully extended at your hips to fully contracted at your shoulders. Grip a barbell or pair of dumbbells with an underhand grip, palms facing out. A leg curl is an exercise in which you bend your knee, lifting your lower leg so your heel moves closer to your glutes (buttocks).</p>
<h3 id="keep-your-shoulders-down-back-straight-and-elbows-glued-to-your-sides">Keep your shoulders down, back straight, and elbows glued to your sides.</h3><p>The hand position is the key to get maximum activation of the targeted area. To perform the concentration curl, sit on a bench and rest whichever arm you choose on the leg of the same side and let the weight hang down naturally. The bicep leg curl is a very effective bodyweight isolation exercise for building muscle and strength. The hand position is the key to get maximum activation of the targeted area. The regular body drag curl was a favorite of the late, great vince gironda for targeting the biceps. One of the best big exercises for biceps is the barbell cheat curl because the ‘cheat’ during the concentric portion of this curling exercise allows us to create great eccentric overload.</p>

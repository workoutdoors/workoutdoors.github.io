<p>If you feel seriously fatigued, over several days, you can definitely scale back your training and take an extra rest day or two. With the exception of legs (aside from legs day i try and run 3x / week), i�ve been considering a routine that hits each upper body muscle group twice per week, focusing mostly on compound lifts. This leads to debilitating delayed onset muscles soreness (doms) and leads to one burning out quickly. No need to schedule pushing and pulling exercises or anything else that often confuses and overwhelms newcomers.</p>
<h3 id="some-lifters-prefer-more-volume-than-this">Some lifters prefer more volume than this.</h3><p>Depending on the frequency, your session can be shorter. This leads to debilitating delayed onset muscles soreness (doms) and leads to one burning out quickly. For added variety, you could use different set and rep schemes on different training days. While a 5 day bro split only targets each muscle group once a week, there will be some inevitable overlap in the muscles worked. This also enables you to perform different types of exercises such as big compound lifts and isolation exercises all at different set and rep ranges. Strictly speaking, you’re not training each muscle group twice a week.</p>

<p>It involves 5 consecutive workouts in a row. The upper / lower / push/pull / legs trains each muscle group twice per week by combing two different split routines.

<p>For example, your anterior delts will be worked on both chest and shoulder days, so they will be hit twice a week.

<p>I felt like i was devoting too much time on legs, while trying to cram my entire upper body into one workout twice a week.

<p>This leads to debilitating delayed onset muscles soreness (doms) and leads to one burning out quickly. The upper/lower split is a bit better: Hence, targetting every muscle group once a week is better. With a 5 day split, you work the entire muscle group and then it basically has an entire week to recover before the next session. Some lifters.</p>

<p>Biologically, it only takes ~72 hours for a broken muscle to recover. Basically been following my own routine, typical 5 day split (chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms) but i feel i need to mix it up a bit. It�s a 3 day split that should be performed twice a week, with a day break between a and b workouts. I.</p>

<p>Training 4 times a week, you hit each muscle 2 times per week. With a 5 day split, you work the entire muscle group and then it basically has an entire week to recover before the next session. The 5 day split workout is extremely manageable, you hit the gym 5 days a week and focus on an individual muscle.</p>

<p>I can�t train anymore than 5 days a week, so i�m looking for a program that hits each muscle group twice (maybe something like chest/back, shoulders/arms, legs, chest/back, shoulders/arms) In a 5 day split, you work on each muscle group of your body on a different day, so usually don’t even work out the same muscle group more than once.</p>

<p>Also, the 5 day split offers two rest days. I felt like i was devoting too much time on legs, while trying to cram my entire upper body into one workout twice a week. This also enables you to perform different types of exercises such as big compound lifts and isolation exercises all at different set and rep ranges. This.</p>

<p>The 5 day split workout is extremely manageable, you hit the gym 5 days a week and focus on an individual muscle group each workout. For example, your anterior delts will be worked on both chest and shoulder days, so they will be hit twice a week. Strictly speaking, you’re not training each muscle group twice a week. In a.</p>

<p>I still want to be able to hit each muscle group twice a week, so what do you think about this: Depending on the frequency, your session can be shorter. Basically been following my own routine, typical 5 day split (chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms) but i feel i need to mix it up a bit. I can�t train anymore.</p>

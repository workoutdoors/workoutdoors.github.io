I work out and eat clean because my body is a temple and I From pinterest.co.uk</p>
<p>I work out because i like it. Play soccer, hang with my girlfriend, and cook. I workout because it�s good for me. Whole, natural foods like lean meat, beans, fresh vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.</p>
<h3 id="i-workout-because-i-want-to-look-after-my-body-and-my-mind">I workout because i want to look after my body and my mind.</h3><p>Sometimes i eat sweet cereal with some honey and dried fruits. I have to get off of the anxiety meds for work, and i�m scared that i am going to lose weight again. Not what it looks like on some possibly dodgy fitspo page. I like eating fruit means that i enjoy eating fruit, when i taste an apple or an orange etc i feel good. Sure, i workout because i like seeing my muscles grow. Funny tees with sayings like “i run for pizza” or “i run because i really like beer” goofily sum up the way many of us think.</p>

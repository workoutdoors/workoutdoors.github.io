<h3 id="on-the-westside-barbell-training-program-you-train-the-squat-and-deadlift-twice-per-week">On the westside barbell training program you train the squat and deadlift twice per week.</h3><p>3 sets of 3 reps wide grip. The westside barbell powerlifting team uses three different types of exercises in their workouts: Deadlift 8 sets of 3 reps with 75% of your max deadlift. 3 sets of 12 reps rack pulls (set the rack safety pins where the bar will rest on the right below the knee) 3 sets of 12 reps bent over rows. Follow this program for eight weeks and watch your maxes soar. I really enjoy the simple format he uses to break down the workout and define each phase.</p>

As long as you have protein in your post workout drink that’s all the recovery you need. Supplementing your workout with afterglow recovery drink will reduce soreness by giving your body the nutrients it needs to recover fast.</p>

I also did a review for afterglow post workout supplement. (960 g) biorhythm after glow post workout euphoria is an instant total body recovery with zero refined sugars, and over 10 grams of glutamine &amp; bcaas per serving. Keep that glow going with afterglow. You can buy them in tubs (4.23lbs). It’s got lots of potassium and 20 grams of protein.</p>

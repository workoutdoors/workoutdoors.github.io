<p>Bone tissue is made up of osteoclasts (cells responsible for breaking down bone in a process called resorption) and osteoblasts, cells responsible for depositing new bone. The bone, estrogen, strength training (best) study set out to answer these questions. Exercise reduces harmful estrogens in women at risk for breast cancer by decreasing fat levels and increasing lean tissue. This resistance training program resulted in a significant increase in bone mineral density of the greater trochanter for both males and females.</p>

Not only do estrogen and exercise have additive effects by increasing bone mineral density, but the increase in muscular strength and functional capacity that occurs in response to exercise also reduces the incidence of osteoporotic fractures by reducing the risk of Out of these aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises are all effective in increasing the bone mineral density of the spine in postmenopausal women.[ 17 ] Exercise normalizes estrogen in perimenopause and menopausal women (if it’s done at the right dose).

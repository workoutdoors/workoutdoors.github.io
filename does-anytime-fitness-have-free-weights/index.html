<p>Most anytime fitness locations offer the following amenities, although the amenities may vary slightly from club to club: My guess is that equipment availability at any specific af location depends mainly on the size of the space and the size/demands of the membership, as it would for any other. Cardio machines are equipped with personal tv�s so you are kept entertained throughout your workout. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional prior to beginning any diet or exercise program or taking any dietary supplement.</p>
<h3 id="they-do-have-a-few-of-the-functional-machines-but-only-the-basic-ones">They do have a few of the functional machines but only the basic ones.</h3><p>Not the assisted smith machine but normal bench press. Cardio machines are equipped with personal tv�s so you are kept entertained throughout your workout. Aka no hip abductions or lying leg curl. Not the assisted smith machine but normal bench press. Anytime fitness does have a squat rack, a platform, a smith machine, a leg press, and a training area with rope and kettlebells, but other than that it’s just cardio and free weights really. Anytime fitness (riverwood) all classes are included in the membership fee.</p>

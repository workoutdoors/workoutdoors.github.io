Good vibe, don’t frown and let the monster see. The workouts alternate between “pushing” muscles and “pulling” muscles so that you do push, pull, push one week, and then pull, push, pull the next. Typically, i would recommend either 5 days on, 2 days off (monday through friday with weekends off). You can still sleep in.

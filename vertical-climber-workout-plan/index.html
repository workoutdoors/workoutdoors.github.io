<h3 id="my-gym-has-a-versaclimber-and-i-found-it-way-too-challenging">My gym has a versaclimber, and i found it way too challenging.</h3><p>I definitely miss it but its a tough cardio workout. Increase your pace slightly higher. But definitely, you need to work with the dumbbells separately for your glut muscle.

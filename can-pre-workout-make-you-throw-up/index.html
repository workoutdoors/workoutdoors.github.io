It�s super important to know.</p>
<h3 id="i-am-also-taking-creatine">I am also taking creatine.</h3><p>But to the point where your body violently reacts is idiotic.

Becoming nervous or anxious before your workout can lead to nausea, especially if you are competing against the clock. I usually don�t eat 3 or 4 hours before the workout.</p>

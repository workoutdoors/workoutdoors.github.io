<p>Most importantly, the patrons are polite and any ill mannered customers are not tolerated. It�s fairly new in this area so the gym is not packed at all, but with the amazing low rates i don�t doubt that a lot of people will switch over to planet fitness. Social planet business customer service 1/10/2017 thank for the love, ali. There�s new management and the team seems better somehow.</p>
<h3 id="planet-fitness-ceo-chris-rondeau-discussed-how-the-coronavirus-pandemic-has-affected-the-gym-chain-and-how-the-company-is-responding-to-the-crisisfor-access">Planet fitness ceo chris rondeau discussed how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the gym chain and how the company is responding to the crisis.for access.</h3><p>5 reviews of planet fitness big, affordable with lots of amenities. But in some locations, they do allow free trials for teenagers between 13 and 18, given their guardian is with them. It�s now a 24 hour gym. 24 hour fitness might have the snappy branding, but planet fitness is open 24/7 at most locations, as well. Guest that come with the member don�t have access to these features but still have access to all the gym equipment. Planet fitness should be open 24/7 not 24/5.</p>

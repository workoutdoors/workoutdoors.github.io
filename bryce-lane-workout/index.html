<p>I suspect i�m not alone. Today�s workout was developed by bryce lane. Bryce writes i have thought many times about one workout that could give you �it all� or as close to it as possible. Similarly, around 2002, a man named bryce lane wrote a 20 minute density training program i’ve seen called the “50/20 method”.</p>

Pick a big compound exercise that can be loaded pretty heavily. .an intermediate lifter, go for the madcow 5x5 or bryce lane�s have it all workout, or look into the texas method.

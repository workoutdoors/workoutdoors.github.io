<p>Tooth extraction, even getting a wisdom tooth pulled, is a fairly straightforward procedure. If you are following your dentist�s instructions regarding exercise and recovery time, your mouth and gums should heal properly. The general recommendation for exercise after tooth extraction is that the patient not physically exert himself in the first 24 hours after the procedure. Exercise for the next.</p>

<p>We also recommend not doing any type of exercise for the first three or four days. Any physical exertion or exercise causes an increase in blood pressure, which can cause the extraction site to actively bleed or ooze. Hot tubs are usually just a few hundred gallon of water to not much more than 1,000 gallons for the larger ones.</p>

<p>If you aren�t sure whether you need to take time off work after having a tooth out, ask your dentist for advice. But it can still be traumatic to a small area. Levitin will provide you with a more specific time frame. If you can�t take a lot of time off work, it�s worth scheduling your extraction for a friday.</p>

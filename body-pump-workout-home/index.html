<h3 id="as-they-say-in-new-zealand-that039s-a-lot-of-reps-mate">As they say in new zealand, that�s a lot of reps, mate!</h3><p>The in home version of les mills bodypump sticks to its counterparts theme, feel, and uses the very same techniques used in the class. Incorporating specific audio tracks designed to guide students through the hourlong exercise, body pump focuses on strengthening eight separate muscle groups by lifting, thrusting and squatting with various weights. You look your best at the end of a workout when your muscles are filled with blood, making your frame look bigger, stronger and harder thats the famed pump.

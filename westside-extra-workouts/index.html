<p>I’ve heard that at westside the lifters do a lot of extra workouts. Three sets of seated dumbbell power cleans. Sample westside barbell max effort workout. Three sets of seated dumbbell power cleans.</p>
<h3 id="rotate-from-flat-incline-decline-and-seated-press">Rotate from flat, incline, decline, and seated press.</h3><p>Three sets of seated dumbbell power cleans. Workout #4 two sets of benching for 25 reps. I decided against using the westside name in the title of the program for two reasons: These workouts often include sled pulling, reverse hyper, bodybuilding accessories, ghr, dumbbell work for time, jumps, and virtually anything you can think of that might aid in improving overall gpp and work capacity. We know that ideally a workout should last 45 to 60 minutes due to our energy and testosterone levels dropping after this, but we also know that in order to achieve the goals we set, we must do more. The extra workouts may consist of sled pulling.</p>

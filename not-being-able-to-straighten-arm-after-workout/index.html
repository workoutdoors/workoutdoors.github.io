<p>Its like my arms are locked at 30 angle (bicep/tricep are tensed). If you’re experiencing worse than just normal muscle soreness see a doctor. Dislocated or hyperextended elbow joint. Best thing i can suggest when people get back into lifting is to work on muscular endurance for a couple weeks before anything else. This happens to most (if not all).</p>

<p>What to ask your doctor. Inhale and lift your shoulders up towards your ears. If you can’t straighten your arm after a workout it could be due to a condition or injury that has occurred. But, the one heavy pain i have is that i can�t straighten my arms. This happens to most (if not all) people when they start.</p>

<p>If anybody knows how to fix it throught workouts or exercises kindly help me out I heard three muffled crunches on the inner elbow. Ask if he thinks there will be a bump or deformity after the cast comes off. Adequate preparation before training is essential to prevent excessive muscle pain and soreness. At best, my forearm makes a 40.</p>

<p>When you find you can’t physically move your elbow to straighten out your arm it is recommended that you have it assessed by a doctor, ignoring the issue could cause permanent damage. Lie on the floor “face upwards” and place a pillow under your forearm so that your arm may rest with a slight amount of stretch. In january i.</p>

<p>If you’re experiencing worse than just normal muscle soreness see a doctor. If i�m not trying to straighten my arm, i have no pain at all. Many doctors told me its not an ortheopedic problem. Basically i�m unable to let my arms casually straight next to my body, i almost can�t even put on a tshirtby myself. After maybe 5.</p>

<p>I felt this immediately after working out, and it�s only gotten worse. I warmed up and cooled down aerobically, but didn�t do any real stretching. No swelling the next day, but my right hand was so cold it turned blue. So it’s not a quick process. The pain is such that i can�t use the arm as i normally would.</p>

<p>However, if you literally can’t straighten your arm a few days after a round of bicep curls, it’s probably time to call the doctor. Lifting anything like a laptop from the table with one arm is painful, etc.). It commonly appears the day after intense exercise because the muscles are not sufficiently prepared, or those who exercise are not in.</p>

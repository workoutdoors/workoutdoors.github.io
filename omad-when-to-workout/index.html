</center> <p><strong>Omad When To Workout</strong>, Omad, also known as the one meal a day eating lifestyle, is an even more extreme version of intermittent fasting. Strength training in an omad fasted state can burn more calories then snacking beforehand.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://workoutdoors.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=omad%20when%20to%20workout" alt="This is how my OMAD (one meal a day) schedule looks like" title="This is how my OMAD (one meal a day) schedule looks like" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https:\/\/workoutdoors.github.io\/img\/placeholder.svg';" class="center" />
This is how my OMAD (one meal a day) schedule looks like From pinterest.com</p>
<p>During the day, i drink two cups of coffee in the morning with a splash of heavy cream. This gives you time to digest and ensures your body has enough fuel to work properly. Some would regard omad as a type of 23:1 fasting, but the difference is trivial. 20:4 fasting is done in a straightforward 20 hours of fasting followed by 4 hours of eating.</p>
<h3 id="but-before-you-get-too-excited-lets-dig-in-a-little-more">But, before you get too excited, let’s dig in a little more.</h3><p>But, before you get too excited, let’s dig in a little more. Be sure you are drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day before and after your workout. Omad as a diet doesn’t directly impact your ability to workout but it may influence when you want to workout as you may want a pre workout or post workout. According to the blog on the main page of the website, the best time to work out or do whatever exercise that you like to do, is at the very end of your fast, and you will actually burn up to 20% more fat calories when you exercise at that time than you will do at any other time. If you usually eat your one meal a day around 5 pm, then consider doing your workout routine or exercise around 3 or 4 pm. This is a 23:1 ratio.</p>

<p>I do most of my workouts fasted, but i’ll often still supp up to prevent catabolism.

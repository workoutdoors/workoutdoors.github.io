A level scoop weighed in between 5 and 6 grams, so i’d imagine you can actually use a little bit less than a full level scoop to get a true single serving. Completely natural and transparent ingredient formula; Hard to believe that this is the fourth rendition of the bpw top ten list. Anyone who trains, runs, or plays sports will enjoy using lean. As a fat burner pre workout, herolean doesn’t really mess around with pump ingredients and just goes straight to the stimulants.</p>

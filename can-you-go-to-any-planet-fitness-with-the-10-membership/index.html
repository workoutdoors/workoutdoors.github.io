Fitness TV Commercial, �Amazing Deal 99 for 1 From ispot.tv</p>
<p>Thus $10 a month turns into $39 a year plus the cost of 11 additional months unless you can get out of the annual commitment, which seems unlikely based on an faq on planet fitness’ site: No, in planet fitness $ 10 membership (planet fitness classic membership), you get access to the club you signed up for. Yes, if you take a classic planet fitness membership, you need to pay only $10 bucks a month. And that is roughly the same as one month’s netflix subscription!</p>
<h3 id="your-membership-on-the-other-hand-can-be-upgraded-to-the-black-card-membership">Your membership, on the other hand, can be upgraded to the black card membership.</h3><p>I have the $20/mo version and shower there almost exclusively on my travels. The membership cost for the classic membership is just $10 per month. Planet fitness is hands down the most affordable gym membership available right now. Brampton, on 0 8 5/26/2015 dunno why the hate on this place. Like others said, you need black card for being able to use any planet fitness club. The answer is that you are allowed to visit any planet fitness location (with a black card) that is not your home gym 10x in a calendar month.</p>

<p>// werbung what makes this beginner friendly? I used basic movements, that are not too complicated or hard to. // werbung you don�t need any equipment or weights!! A full body workout is a training routine that focuses on working all of the major muscle groups in each training session.</p>
<h3 id="i-used-basic-movements-that-are-not-too-complicated-or-hard-to">I used basic movements, that are not too complicated or hard to.</h3><p>With other types of workouts, you might have an upper body day, or chest day, or arm day, or leg day, or back and biceps day, or push day, or something similar. If so, this probably isn’t the best full body workout to go with. When taking a look at a full body workout routine, you should pay attention to how comprehensive it is. Like the bench press, this exercise also targets the chest, shoulders and triceps, but shifts the emphasis to the upper part of the chest. This differs from a body part split, which focuses on a few muscle groups per training session. However, unlike training splits in which you do multiple exercises for one muscle group, you’re doing fewer movements for each one and hitting them in a balanced approach.</p>

<p>We start off with a cardio warm up, then move into an intense obliques workout, and then an equally intense hiit cardio workout, with a nice cool down and stretch to wrap things up. It is a volatile mix of cardio and ab centric moves that drains fat from your abdominal section, while strengthening your core. You�ll repeat this process for 20 minutes straight. Ab workouts, by many measures, are quite short.</p>

Thus it’s a form of interval training, which while not quite hiit, is still absolutely intense. Insane abs is one of the most innovative ab workouts ever created. However, one of the biggest controversies when it comes to exercise and fat loss is whether you should do cardio in a “fed” or a “fasted” state. Home fat burning workouts are a staple of any successful trainee’s training arsenal. You will get all of this done in just 45 minutes!</p>

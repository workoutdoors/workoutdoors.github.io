<p>How long until you can start working out after microblading? Can i workout after getting my eyebrows microbladed? Does this mean that you can never exercise? I know that there are some of you out there who have to exercise. After 24 hours just applied thin layer of ointment morning and night exactly as advised.</p>

<p>Now, listen up because if you do decide to get your brows done, this part is super important: You can exercise to your heart�s content but only once your brows are completely healed (meaning you don�t have any scabs or open wounds). Can i exercise after microblading touch up? Not only do i have eyebrows now, i have perfect brows!.</p>

<p>Avoid working out or sweating profusely until after 10 days. Do not leave brows wet with sweating. Good for everyday but not sure about the water sports. So go ahead and hit pause on. Immediately after, the area will be extremely dark and get darker over the next 2 days as a scab forms in the area.</p>

<p>Avoid working out or sweating profusely until after 10 days. Not to mention that face sweating is mostly concentrated on the forehead, dripping down and accumulating on the eyebrow area. Technically, you can (with extreme caution), but i don’t trust myself to exercise the necessary level of restraint. While it’s ok, and highly recommend to wash the eyebrows with soap.</p>

<p>After 24 hours just applied thin layer of ointment morning and night exactly as advised. The healing process mostly lasts 7 days, but it is recommended to wait for at least 10 days (source of information?) before the first workout, just to be on the safe side. Give yourself extra time for the appointment to ensure the best results. Cleaned.</p>

<p>Ive followed my aftercare down to a t. Good for everyday but not sure about the water sports. Do not use makeup, specifically on brows, it can fade pigment fast. So i go heavy on the dry shampoo. You must avoid working out for 7 days following your microblading appointment.</p>

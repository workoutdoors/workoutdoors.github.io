<p>But it turns out that exercise doesn�t actually cause this feeling or make it more likely to happen, says richard rosenfeld, md, mph , chairman and program director of otolaryngology (ent) at suny. “that’s why people swallow, chew gum and pinch their nose and gently blow — to get their eustachian tube to open,” says dr. Heavy exertion, such as straining while lifting weights, causes intracranial pressure (pressure within the brain), which in turn leads to pressure within the ears. It also acts as a deterrent to water when you go swimming, bathing, or whenever you are in moist surroundings.</p>

This condition is often due to blocked eustachian tubes from a cold, allergies or a sinus infection. I can run all day and nothing but if i lift hard my ears clog up until i stop. With plugged ears, your eustachian tubes — which run between your middle ear and the back of your nose — become blocked. They just aren’t working right. Or maybe you�re sweating directly into your ear canals.</p>

<p>Ear clogging is due to the blockage of eustachian tube.

<p>Ear clogging is due to the blockage of eustachian tube. After all, your blood is busy being useful somewhere else (your brain or your bicep, perhaps). It connects the middle ear to the back of the nose. Lifting weights can damage your inner ears. “that’s why people swallow, chew gum and pinch their nose and gently blow — to get.</p>

<p>Can snorting creatine cause any health problems? If you snort creatine up your nose, you are going to irritate your lungs, which is asking for trouble. Of course this is not how the manufacturers intended these powders to be consumed, and it won’t increase their effectiveness, but this is indeed the craziest example of supplement abuse i’ve ever seen. And i doubt snorting a pre workout supp would do anything at all considering you need like a whole scoop of those thangs</p>
<h3 id="remember-it-is-not-a-drug">Remember, it is not a drug;</h3><p>Oil can be good for you. Do not snort your pre workout powder, it is not crack no matter how energized you feel after taking it. You would think this one would be obvious, but it never fails that someone out there thinks, “i know how to get my pre workout to kick in immediately, snort it!” Piana would snort lines of workout supplements as if it were cocaine, according. You would think this one would be obvious to avoid, but it never fails that someone out there thinks, “i know how to get my pre workout powder to kick in immediately, snort it!” this is made clear by the countless videos of people snorting pre workout supplements on youtube. In other words, it will do nothing more than what it was intended to do.</p>

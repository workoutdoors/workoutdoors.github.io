<p>Bill star 5x5 workout routine spreadsheet. Failure to achieve 5x5 with a given weight for three consecutive workouts calls for a deload, which means you decrease the weight by 10 percent for your next workout. Each workout you increase the working weight by 2.5kg, a total of 7.5kg per week, 7.5kg x 12 = 90kg, so in 12 weeks time.</p>

<p>You can start this program doing 5x5, but you will need to switch to 3x5 soon enough as 5x5 is going to become too much. See, compound exercises work more than one muscle group at a time, plus they often work your core too. In combination with eating at a slight caloric deficit, i was able to lose 15 pounds.</p>

<p>The stronglifts 5×5 program alternates between two workouts, three times a week with at least one full day of rest between workouts. My version of the classic 5x5s keeps the weight heavy, but differs in two important ways. Squats, 3 sets, 5 reps.

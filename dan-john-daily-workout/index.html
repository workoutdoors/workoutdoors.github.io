<p>It now includes a very powerful workout generator that will create custom workouts for you based on your equipment options (this is big), your fitness level, and your schedule. Why should you try easy strength? The goblet squat is an incredible exercise that was popularized by legendary strength &amp; conditioning coach dan john (one of the most genuine and respected individuals in the our industry). I stumbled across a blog post of his detailing a program where you do the same exact lifts every day for forty days in a row.</p>
<h3 id="in-two-weeks-try-to-do-this-workout-six-or-seven-times">In two weeks, try to do this workout six or seven times.”</h3><p>So, do your presses, your one arm presses, your hills sprints, your swings and get younger. Doing bench and curls all the time leads to “the old man look.”. Push, pull, hinge, squat, loaded carry. Something that dan john would call “punching the clock” workout. I stumbled across a blog post of his detailing a program where you do the same exact lifts every day for forty days in a row.

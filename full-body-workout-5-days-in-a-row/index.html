<h3 id="i-bench-squat-leg-curl-calf-press-lateral-raise-do-chin-ups-do-several-ab-exercises-and-row-every-day">I bench, squat, leg curl, calf press, lateral raise, do chin ups, do several ab exercises and row every day.</h3><p>It is possible to train 4 days in a row working the same muscles. Yo, was just wondering if it�s alright to workout 5 days in a row (monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday &amp; friday) and then taking the weekends as rest days. A good full body workout would incorporate all or most of these exercises in the same day. I recently started training 5 instead of 3 days. To do two full body wourkouts in a row as the only training in the week you would have to manage volume, intensity, recovery and overlap in quite a tricky way, lots of chances of screwing it up regarding maximizing gains and preventing injury. In an ideal world, you’ll have a day of rest between each workout.</p>
